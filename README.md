in between slides.

About The Name
--------------

ASQ stands for Answer, Slide, Question.
It is the core concept of this app, where you have a **S**lide followed by a
**Q**uestion where you submit your answer and finaly the correct **A**nswer is
given.
The three initials: A, S, Q reorganized give ASQ.
This was an idea from Max.
